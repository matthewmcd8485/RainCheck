## 🛠 How It Works

### 1. **Search for a City**
Type the name of the city in the search bar, and RainCheck will fetch weather data in real time using the **WeatherAPI**.

### 2. **View Weather Details**
Once you select a city, RainCheck displays:
   - Temperature (°F)
   - Humidity (%)
   - UV Index
   - Feels Like (°F)
   - A weather condition icon.

### 3. **Save Your City**
After selecting a city, RainCheck saves it locally. When you reopen the app, the saved city's updated weather is displayed automatically.
